        <h2>üìú About</h2>
        <p>
          In a galaxy far, far away was born a creature that belonged to the
          human species. At a very young age he was deeply interested in
          technology that would pave the way for him to go in a direction where
          he would learn the foundation of how the technology works so that one
          day he would make an impact on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The year in that galaxy was 2012 where he decided that he would embark
          on a journey to learn from the masters of the game. So that's what he
          did. He took off on a plane and landed in a country called Ukraine
          where he would study for 5 years. During those years he studied the
          fundamental principles that encapsulates Technology such as Computer
          Networks, Computer Architecture, Algorithms and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2017 after the graduation he knew it was time for him to leave and
          embark on a new journey in order to grow as a person and expand his
          knowledge. And once again he took off on a plane and landed in a
          country called Germany. The journey was very challenging, The language
          in which the locals spoke was unfamiliar to him. So he only had one
          option and that was to learn the local language at a high level in
          order to reach his destination. He has been living ever since there
          and has been expanding his knowledge in the field of Web Development.
